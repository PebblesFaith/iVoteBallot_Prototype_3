 To Whom It May Concern:
 
I am writing to report a concerning incident that occurred on August 29, 2023. As the owner of the Apple Mini M1 device and developer of the iVoteBallot_Prototype_2 application, I recently discovered that my device was subjected to unauthorized and malicious activity. This breach involved intentional and willful hacking into my system, specifically targeting my Visual Studio Code (VSC) and the Node Package Manager web application associated with my project.
 
The unauthorized access to my system led to tampering and manipulation of crucial files within my company's iVoteBallot_Prototype_2 folder. This unauthorized activity reached a point where I encountered issues executing the "alabama_Candidates_2024_02.ejs" file. Notably, attempts to close the candidates' scoresheet modals using the "<span>" element "X" were unsuccessful due to the tampering.
 
In response to this breach, I took immediate action. On August 27, 2023, I retrieved a copy of the untampered "alabama_Candidates_2024_02.ejs" file from a backup of my iVoteBallot_Prototype_2 folder. Subsequently, I copied the necessary files, including "alabama_Candidates_2024_02.ejs," "alabama_Candidates_2024_02.css," and "alabama_Candidates_2024_02_Script.js," into my VSC's Node Package Manager under the iVoteBallot_Prototype_2 file folder. The compromised files, which were manipulated by the hackers, were deleted.
 
However, the issues did not end there. While addressing the damage caused by the unauthorized access, I observed a disturbing pattern. It seems that the hackers might have gained remote viewing capabilities, as they appeared to be creating duplicate files for every original file associated with the iVoteBallot_Prototype_2 web application. This activity resulted in additional complications within my development environment, introducing unnecessary challenges in terms of programmatic languages.
 
Regrettably, due to the severity of this breach and the subsequent disruptions it caused, I am left with no choice but to recreate the entire iVoteBallot_Prototype_2 web application file folder. As a precautionary measure, I have also taken the step of changing all passwords associated with my personal computer devices to mitigate any further instances of unauthorized interference.
 
I would like to stress the urgency of this matter, as the interference caused by the hacking incident has resulted in significant delays in my web application development. I kindly request that appropriate actions be taken to investigate this incident and provide guidance on how to enhance the security measures for my devices and applications moving forward.
 
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
 
Sincerely,

Sarai Hannah Ajai
