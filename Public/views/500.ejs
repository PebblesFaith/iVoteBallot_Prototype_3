<!--
	Sarai Hannah Ajai have written her 500.ejs file for the sole purpose to display an error message
	when an user requests a page that does not exist. The HTML code in the file is styled using CSS to ensure
	that the error message is presented in a clear and visually appealing manner. The CSS styling is applied
	to various elements in the file, including the title, headings, paragraphs, and links. And, Ms. Ajai
	overall aim is to provide users with a helpful message that explains why they are seeing the error and
	what they can do to resolve the issue.

								Server Errors: HTTP 500 errors are typically caused by server-side errors, such as problems
								with the web server or database that is hosting the iVoteBallot website. This can include issues
								with the server's hardware or software, configuration errors, or problems with the server's
								network connection.
							</li>
							<li>
								Application Errors: The iVoteBallot application itself may be experiencing errors that are
								causing the HTTP 500 error message to appear. This can include coding errors, bugs in the
								application's functionality, or issues with the application's database.
							</li>
							<li>
								Database Errors: If the iVoteBallot website relies heavily on a database to store and retrieve
								information, errors with the database can cause HTTP 500 errors. This can include problems with
								the database's schema, data corruption, or issues with the database's connectivity.
							</li>
							<li>
								Configuration Errors: HTTP 500 errors can also occur if there are issues with the configuration
								of the iVoteBallot website, such as incorrect file permissions, misconfigured web server settings,
								or problems with the website's DNS configuration.
							</li>
							<li>
								Traffic Overload: If the iVoteBallot website is experiencing a high volume of traffic, it may
								be overwhelmed and unable to handle the requests it is receiving. This can cause the web server
								to fail and result in HTTP 500 errors for users trying to access the site.
